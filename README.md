(Traffic Party: Party on the go! Defeat L.A. insanely long traffic congestion!)

## Inspiration
**L.A.'s traffic congestion is the world's worst for sixth straight year, according to a report by INRIX ([source](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-la-worst-traffic-20180206-story.html)).** Despite the city spending $1.6 billion and 5 years to expand the 405 Freeway Sepulveda Pass to add a lane for each direction, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority conducted a study showing traffic time has gotten worse ([source](https://www.scpr.org/blogs/economy/2014/10/10/17413/405-traffic-a-little-slower-after-1-billion-upgrad)). Adding more road capacity does not reduce traffic congestion; rather, it just causes more driving. **To accommodate L.A. slow traffic, we believe that our mobile application can underpinnings the frustration of waiting in traffic.**

## What it does
Sick of Los Angeles traffic? Take the frustration away with the Traffic Party app, available on iOS! 
The app aims to connect the nearby commuters to engage in a fun activity during their long commute.  A user can simply host a traffic party which will notify nearby users who are stuck in the same traffic to join or  join a party that is already happening nearby.

(We produced trending design patterns to make next app fresh and competitive)

## How we built it
**User interface (UI):**
- Figma (Mockups and Designs)
- Adobe Illustrator (Illustrations)

## Challenges we ran into
- Coming up with an original idea that fulfills our requirements in short amount of time
- Implementing Facebook API was difficult using React Native, thus we switched to Swift  
- Slow WiFi when we are collaborate
- Getting access to the mentors who know Swift

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of having beautiful designs for our app during this hackathon. 

## What we learned
Our mentor James gave us amazing advice. He suggests when coming up of ideas, we should look into current day problems and tell a story with our solution. A good pitch tells a story and empathizes with a group of people dealing with this issue. We find there pain points and ask good questions. James also mentioned that a full pledge hackathon project needs prioritize and embraced the teammate memberâ€™s strong skills. Our team was good with mobile development so we thought about ideas surrounding users experience with their smartphone.

## What's next for TrafficParty
We first launched the app with Los Angeles commuters in mind, however, the app is available to anyone who has an iOS. In the future versions, we will add new games and features to the app.
